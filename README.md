projects that I cad 

links are to onshape - (github cant handle my .STEP files (they're too big))

4 Bar Intake - https://cad.onshape.com/documents/186160b77e8ccad5dd5eb827/w/f6a6ead9c8c369b43a015b03/e/91226a23da2b1a3ae0b7902a

p.s. for some reason onshape doesnt like github redirects ?? so i would copy paste that link to another tab
